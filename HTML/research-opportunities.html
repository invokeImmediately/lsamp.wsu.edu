			<p><b>The goal of these programs is to provide early stage students first hand experience with cutting-edge research in a range of departments,</b> including Biology, Chemistry, Bioengineering, Chemical Engineering, Computer Science, Physics, and more. These summer Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REUs) are ten-week research-immersion internship programs at Rice University during the 2021 summer that provide research interns full-time financial support. Students need not have prior research experience to be considered for these summer research opportunities.</p>
			<p>The program is now accepting student applications for Summer 2021 REU opportunities! Interested students should visit: <a href="http://reuapply.rice.edu/">reuapply.rice.edu</a> to begin their application. Priority consideration will be given to students who apply by a priority deadline of February 15, though all applications received by March 1 will be reviewed. A detailed description of their Summer 2021 program offerings, as well as information about their application and deadlines, can be found below:</p>

			<p><a href="https://ibb.rice.edu/nsf-reu-bionetworks"><strong>Bionetworks REU:</strong></a> Hosted by the Institute of Biosciences and Bioengineering (IBB), students in this REU will gain hands-on experience with cutting-edge research needed to predict and analyze biological functions sufficiently to understand complex biological phenomena, reprogram cells to perform new tasks, and prevent diseases. Students from a range of majors are encouraged to apply, including biology, bioengineering, chemistry, chemical engineering, ecology, environmental science, physics, computer science, statistics, or related engineering fields.</p>
			<p><a href="https://ibb.rice.edu/research/undergraduate-programs/bioxfel-summer-internship-undergraduates"><strong>BioXFEL REU:</strong></a> Hosted by IBB, students in this REU will engage in hands-on research studying the structure, function and dynamics of protein molecules that make use of the new and powerful free electron X-ray laser facilities around the world. A trip to Stanford’s facility in the fall to present the students’ work at the annual users’ meeting is also planned. Willingness to work on a team and in molecular studies is required. Majors from biology, chemistry, physics, computer science, or related engineering fields are encouraged to apply.</p>

			<p><a href="https://earthscience.rice.edu/academics/2021-nsf-reu/"><strong>Planetary Habitability REU:</strong></a> Students will explore the intersection of Earth science and life with the goal of understanding what makes a planet hospitable. Topics will include atmospheric sciences, oceanography, soil science, ecology, planetary science, plate tectonics, deep and early Earth processes, and volcanism. This program will include a 5 day field trip to the Western US. Competitive students will be interested in how the Earth works and be willing to travel. Majors from physics, chemistry, geology, environmental science, biology, computer science, or related engineering fields are welcome.</p>

			<h2 class="fs--h4 sv--0mx">APS/IBM Research Internship for Undergraduate Women and Underrepresented Minorities</h2>
			<p>Looking for a paid summer internship to enhance your STEM education? Interested in working at a world-class research facility? <b>APS and IBM co-sponsor two undergraduate research internship programs for women and underrepresented minorities.</b></p>
			<p>The goals of these programs are to encourage women and underrepresented minority undergraduate students to pursue graduate studies in science and engineering. They are also enticing to students because:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Both internship programs feature salaried positions at IBM Research locations that are typically 10 weeks long.</li>
				<li>These internships provide an opportunity for interns to work closely with an IBM mentor.</li>
				<li>You will have the opportunity to travel to either San Jose, CA, Austin, TX, or Yorktown Heights, NY for these positions.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The undergraduate women internships are located at any of the locations, and the research internships for underrepresented minorities are located in San Jose, CA. While the Austin lab focuses on research for software and systems, the other programs have a full range of research opportunities.</p>
			<p>Applications and letters of recommendation are due by February 15, 2021. Find the full details here: <a href="https://www.aps.org/programs/women/scholarships/ibm/index.cfm">https://www.aps.org/programs/women/scholarships/ibm/index.cfm</a></p>
