			<p>The Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (LSAMP) Program is aimed at increasing the quality and quantity of students successfully completing science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) baccalaureate degree programs, and increasing the number of students interested in, academically qualified for and matriculating into programs of graduate study. LSAMP supports sustained and comprehensive approaches that facilitate achievement of the long-term goal of increasing the number of students who earn doctorates in STEM fields, particularly those from populations underrepresented in these fields.</p>
			<p>The Alliance is administered at the University of Washington’s Seattle campus in partnership with staff from each participating partner. Pacific Northwest LSAMP partners implement best practices in STEM diversity initiatives that have been disseminated by existing LSAMP programs around the country. Program vision and direction is provided by an advisory board of chief academic officers, diversity officers and deans from participating institutions. The advisory board works to ensure that the commitment to addressing underrepresentation in STEM is both enduring and institution wide.</p>
