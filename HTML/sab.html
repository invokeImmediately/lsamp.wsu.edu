				<p>I’m from Kennewick WA. I am a first-generation student pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in <a href="https://mme.wsu.edu/undergraduate/mechanical-engineering/">mechanical engineering</a>. This is my third year at WSU. I am currently a peer mentor for the <a href="https://vcea.wsu.edu/stars/">STARS Program</a>. I’m also involved in various <a href="https://studentinvolvement.wsu.edu/rso/">student organizations</a> on campus including the <a href="https://seb.wsu.edu/">Student Entertainment Board (SEB)</a>. One of my favorite things I did this summer was drive around town at night listening to music.</p>

				<p>Hello! My name is Alberto Castaneda and I am currently a junior pursuing a Bachelor&#8217;s degree in <a href="https://school.eecs.wsu.edu/academics/undergraduate-program/electrical-engineering/">Electrical Engineering</a>. I was born and raised in Yakima, WA. I come from a low income family of farm workers where I worked in the fields at a young age. I want to thank my parents for forcing me to work in the fields and allowing me to see that a higher education is needed. I enjoy playing soccer, hiking, and most other outdoor activities. Throughout my experience at WSU, I have been involved in clubs and other organizations.</p>

				<p>Hello, my name is Brandon Garza and I am currently a senior pursuing a Bachelor&#8217;s degree in <a href="https://school.eecs.wsu.edu/academics/undergraduate-program/computer-engineering/">Computer Engineering</a> with a minor in <a href="https://school.eecs.wsu.edu/academics/undergraduate-program/computer-science/">Computer Science</a>.  I was born and raised in Yakima, Washington where I received an Associates of Science degree at <a href="https://www.yvcc.edu/">Yakima Valley College</a> and was involved in the <a href="https://www.yvcc.edu/services/mesa/">MESA program</a> before transferring to WSU.  Throughout my time at WSU I have been involved in multicultural and STEM based organizations, worked on multiple research projects, and have switched majors multiple times before deciding to major in Computer Engineering.  I really enjoy outdoor activities such as hiking and road biking as well as keeping up with the latest trends in technology and science.  As a senior and transfer student, I have gained a lot of experience and made many connections throughout the university that I hope I can use to help future LSAMP students succeed here.</p>
