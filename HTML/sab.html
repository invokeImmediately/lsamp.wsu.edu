				<p>I’m from Kennewick WA. I am a first-generation student pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in <a href="https://mme.wsu.edu/undergraduate/mechanical-engineering/">Mechanical Engineering</a>. This is my third year at WSU. I am currently a peer mentor for the <a href="https://vcea.wsu.edu/stars/">STARS Program</a>. I’m also involved in various <a href="https://studentinvolvement.wsu.edu/rso/">student organizations</a> on campus including the <a href="https://seb.wsu.edu/">Student Entertainment Board (SEB)</a>. One of my favorite things I did this summer was drive around town at night listening to music.</p>

				<p>Hello! My name is Alberto Castaneda and I am currently a junior pursuing a Bachelor&#8217;s degree in <a href="https://school.eecs.wsu.edu/academics/undergraduate-program/electrical-engineering/">Electrical Engineering</a>. I was born and raised in Yakima, WA. I come from a low income family of farm workers where I worked in the fields at a young age. I want to thank my parents for forcing me to work in the fields and allowing me to see that a higher education is needed. I enjoy playing soccer, hiking, and most other outdoor activities. Throughout my experience at WSU, I have been involved in clubs and other organizations.</p>

				<p>Hello everyone! My name is Cecilia Diaz and I am currently pursuing a double degree in <a href="https://ipn.vetmed.wsu.edu/neuroscience">Neuroscience</a> and <a href="https://psychology.wsu.edu/">Psychology</a>. I am a from Wenatchee, WA and have been here at WSU from the start of my college experience as a freshman. This will be my last year and I would be glad to help you create a four year plan, suggest professors for certain classes, give you insight on how each class will be like and be a helping hand whenever you need it to have a successful college experience. I am involved in many multicultural activities/events and STEM based organizations that I can connect you with during your first year. I am working on my own research project in a lab and want to continue this path by obtaining a PhD after graduating. I enjoy drawing, painting, and photo-editing on my free time to relieve some stress. Wishing you all the best for this year!</p>

Throughout my time at WSU I have been involved in multicultural and STEM based organizations, worked on multiple research projects, and have switched majors multiple times before deciding to major in Computer Engineering.  I really enjoy outdoor activities such as hiking and road biking as well as keeping up with the latest trends in technology and science.  As a senior and transfer student, I have gained a lot of experience and made many connections throughout the university that I hope I can use to help future LSAMP students succeed here.</p>
