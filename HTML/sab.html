They help LSAMP Scholars at community colleges, incoming freshmen, transfers, and current LSAMP participants get connected with research and resources; assist in the planning and organizing of workshops and events for the LSAMP program; and create a comfortable, diverse community for underrepresented minorities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM).</p>
			<p>Ambassadors are expected to: </p>
			<ul>
				<li>Regularly communicate with mentees and community college scholars.</li>
				<li>Co-coordinate LSAMP activities (i.e. conferences, trainings, banquets).</li>

				<p>Hello! My name is Joel Estrada I’m from Sunnyside, Washington and I am currently a junior in Mechanical Engineering. I transferred to WSU last fall from Columbia Basin College in Pasco, WA. I chose to go major in mechanical engineering because I like to learn about the way things work and because science has always been my greatest interest. When I’m not doing school work I like working on my car, watching football, online gaming, and helping others. Being a part of the Student Advisory Board will allow me to help incoming students overcome potential challenges and help them find any resource they need.</p>

				<p>Hi! I am Savanna Garza and I will be a junior for fall of 2018. I am currently a Zoology major on the pre- vet track. I am from Bakersfield, CA and my goal is to someday be an army veterinarian. I have always loved all animals, big and small, and want to pursue a path where I can be flexible in any challenge that comes my way. I am active through WSU’s CCE program, zoology club, and microbiology research. I am also a College of Arts and Sciences student ambassador for 2018-2019. In the fall, my favorite thing to do is to go to a cougar football game! If you were to see me anywhere on campus, feel free to say hi and chat!</p>

				<p>Hello! My name is Yoni Rodriguez. I was born and raised in Toppenish, WA which is in the Yakima Valley (Central Washington). I originally went to Eastern Washington University to study Exercise Science. Through a medical internship, I discovered my interest in medicine, public health care and research. I left Eastern Washington University given to refocus and find a school that offered a program that matched my interests. During this time I began my introductory STEM courses at Yakima Valley College. I became involved in MESA and was introduced to LSAMP. I attended LSAMP conference meetings and WSU visitations hosted by LSMAP. This is where I began to make connections with WSU and found the transfer process easily given all the resources MESA, LSAMP, TMP and WSU had set up for transfer students.</p>

				<p>Hi, I&#8217;m Fernando. I grew up in a small town called Grandview, right in the middle of the Tri-Cities and Yakima. I attended the Yakima Valley Community College campus in Grandview before transferring to WSU Tri-Cities and then later on transferring to WSU Pullman. My education goals are to graduate with a bachelors in computer engineering and to have the skill set to succeed in the workforce. Some of my personal interests are hiking, playing basketball or football with friends, and working with electronics.</p>

				<p>Hello! My name is Preston Watanabe, a born and raised Native Hawaiian/Japanese from the town of Wailuku, Maui HI. I am currently a junior here at WSU studying Food Science at CAHNRS college. I chose this major for my love of food and the knowledge that I will have job security for life with this major. I love food, all kinds. Cheese, bacon, hash browns, ice cream, kimchi, pizza, seafood, groundfood, anything you can think of I’ll try at least once. The one thing I love about WSU is how much calories, sodium and sugar they can cram into a single serving of food. Next time you eat at a dining hall, be sure to read the nutrition labels, they’re a site to see. </p>
