				<p>Hello, my name is Brandon Garza and I am currently a senior pursuing a Bachelors in <a href="https://school.eecs.wsu.edu/academics/undergraduate-program/computer-engineering/">Computer Engineering</a> with a minor in <a href="https://school.eecs.wsu.edu/academics/undergraduate-program/computer-science/">Computer Science</a>.  I was born and raised in Yakima, Washington where I received an Associates of Science degree at <a href="https://www.yvcc.edu/">Yakima Valley College</a> and was involved in the <a href="https://www.yvcc.edu/services/mesa/">MESA program</a> before transferring to WSU.  Throughout my time at WSU I have been involved in multicultural and STEM based organizations, worked on multiple research projects, and have switched majors multiple times before deciding to major in Computer Engineering.  I really enjoy outdoor activities such as hiking and road biking as well as keeping up with the latest trends in technology and science.  As a senior and transfer student, I have gained a lot of experience and made many connections throughout the university that I hope I can use to help future LSAMP students succeed here.</p>

				<p>Hello! My name is Jose Gonzalez. I am from a small town, Sunnyside, WA. I am currently a Senior in <a href="https://mme.wsu.edu/undergraduate/mechanical-engineering/">Mechanical Engineering</a>. I did running start my junior year of high school at <a href="https://www.yvcc.edu/">Yakima Valley College</a> and then came here to WSU as a freshman. I chose to be a mechanical engineer because I want to help people by creating new technology and improving existing ones. As a hobby, I love modified cars and playing music. Iâ€™m a chill person and enjoy sharing information that I have accumulated throughout my years here at WSU.</p>
